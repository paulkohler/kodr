# NEXT

Loose, forward-looking candidates only — the rough shape of phases not yet
written. Not a commitment; promote an item into `roadmap.md` + `phases/` when
it is actually next. **Delete an item the moment it ships** — history lives in
the roadmap, phase files, and blog, not here. If a cut idea was really needed it
will resurface on its own.

Current frontier (phase 195): `kodr check` is a comprehensive standalone
diagnostic with `--json`, `--strict`, `--changed`, `--watch`, `--deep`, `--ci`,
`--fix`, and a path argument. Six cross-reference sensors (canonical name registry +
`SENSOR_NAMES` / `SENSOR_SEVERITY` exports; sensors run on applied writes).
`kodr hook install/status/uninstall` manage pre-commit and pre-push gates;
`.kodr/config.json` `hooks` block customises the baked-in command.
Gate-skip reasons are observable via `gateSkips` in JSON output.
`runCrossRefSensorsOnProposal` runs content-safe sensors on dry-run proposals
(`summary.proposalSensors`). Per-sensor toggles via `.kodr/config.json` `sensors`
block (`{ "secret-in-response": false }`) map to `options.sensorToggles`.
Smoke-check heal integration: second heal pass on failure.
`kodr check --fix` synthesises a targeted repair prompt from sensor/syntax findings
and routes it into `runPrompt` (`buildFixPrompt`); each sensor's issue shape is
mapped correctly via `formatSensorIssue`.

## Candidates

### Smoke-as-verification in the heal loop
Phase 184 wired a smoke-driven second heal pass, but the in-loop verification
still uses `options.testCommand`. When no testCommand is set, smoke failures can't
drive repairs. Full smoke-as-verification requires pluggable verification backends
in the heal loop: callers pass a `verify` function instead of a `testCommand` string.
This is a significant architecture change; record here for later.

### Per-step model routing
`--route-auto` (141) picks the best-history model at run start. The open half is
splitting *within* a run: cheap tasks (commit messages, compaction, summaries)
to a `cheapModel`, edits to `editModel`, recording the per-step choice in the
summary so `kodr why` shows which model handled which step.

### Re-decide the @kodr/repomap publish hold
Parked by decision (2026-06-12: no publish until more dogfooding); the
precondition is now met, so this needs a human call and won't resurface on its
own.
